### What is github?
GitHub builds collaboration directly into the development process. Work is organized into repositories, where developers can outline requirements or direction and set expectations for team members.

3. Name your repository *robotics_programming*

2. Click *Branch: Main*

3. Type a branch name `Edits` into the new branch text box.
